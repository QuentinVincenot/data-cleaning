# Data Cleaning

This repository shows off regularly encountered **Data Cleaning** tasks in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning projects.  
I want to expose a set of techniques I found out while learning Data Science throughout my personnal experience, and illustrate them thanks a randomly generated dataset, intentionally inserting errors and wrong data format. The following code in written in Python and mainly uses [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) libraries.

## 1) Dataset generation

## 2) Data cleaning pipeline

## 3) Dataset transformation

### Ideas

- [x] Create date column in dataset generation
- [ ] Create email column in dataset generation
- [ ] Create useless column in dataset generation
- [ ] Generate random unwanted values in date column
- [ ] Generate random unwanted values in email column
- [x] Generate null values in date column
- [ ] Generate null values in email column
- [ ] Illustrate useless column deletion
