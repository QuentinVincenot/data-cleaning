# Data Cleaning

This repository shows off regularly encountered **Data Cleaning** tasks in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning projects.  
I want to expose a set of techniques I found out while learning Data Science throughout my personnal experience, and illustrate them thanks a randomly generated dataset, intentionally inserting errors and wrong data format. The following code in written in Python and mainly uses [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) libraries.

## 1) Dataset generation

## 2) Data cleaning pipeline

## 3) Dataset transformation
